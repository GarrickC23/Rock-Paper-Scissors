# Rock-Paper-Scissors

* Built a simple Rock Paper Scissors game utilizing Javscript, HTML, and CSS. 
* Attempted to code it myself but it was hard to combine the HTML and Javascript aspects, but I left the original javascript.js file
* Followed the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) to compare my own code and learn how to build the game better
